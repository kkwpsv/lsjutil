        /// so that system caching is not in effect, then the data is immediately flushed to disk without going through the Windows system cache.

        /// Using these flags together avoids those penalties.
        /// For general information about the caching of files and metadata, see File Caching.
        /// When <see cref="FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING"/> is combined with <see cref="FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED"/>,
        /// the flags give maximum asynchronous performance, because the I/O does not rely on the synchronous operations of the memory manager.

        /// Also, the file metadata may still be cached (for example, when creating an empty file).
        /// To ensure that the metadata is flushed to disk, use the <see cref="FlushFileBuffers"/> function.
